### Thanks for stopping by!

I'm currently a software engineering student working with Java, C++, SQL, and other languages.   

My most recent projects can be found on my [CV page](https://portfolio-anngineers-projects.vercel.app/) and described in my [blog posts](https://anngineer.substack.com/). 

My [web development portfolio](https://anngineer.com/) uses React, SCSS/CSS, HTML, Javascript, JSX, and responsive design. 

If you are interested in collaboration or have any questions, please feel free to contact me at [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/anngineer).
